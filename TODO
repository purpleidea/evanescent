1) watch configuration file for changed exclusions through a FILE io watcher.
if any changes are made, then kill the sleeping loop and make it run right away.
look at comments in: def get_exclusions_changed_time()


2) add a way to add buttons via the msg function... our info dialog could then
have help, don't bug me, or other useful buttons maybe? update: some notify
daemons (newbuntu: 9.04) don't support this i believe. maybe avoid buttons if
possible ?


3) add some love to the config.py and associated managing of configurations.


4) deb package


5) support for additional actions instead of logout?
this should be stored in the .eva.conf.yaml file, and should be parsed by the
evanescent-preferences program, similar in visual design to vino-preferences.
do: apt-get source vino and have a look inside the capplet/ folder.


6) option to have eva running, and to disable the shutdown backend. or viceversa
note: to disable backend, just put an exclude on user `root' (or whatever user
it runs as... see the faq for a better explanation)


7) fix all the TODO's


8) add test cases!


9) add _() for gettext, get the gettext infrastructure cooking


10) fix the icon size business.


11) play a sound on idle (libcanberra?)


12) dependency checking:
package: libxss-dev
package: yaml, pynotify


13) setup.py script has hardcoded directories.


14) logout.py needs a bit more love (just got some dbus up in there)


15) setup.py needs some love


16) evanescent-daemon should maybe run as user daemon or eva or some other user account to give it less priviledges.


17) add support for gconf (eg: to replace yaml or add an additional parser, or perhaps in particular for the users config and not the daemon's)


18) countdown could update at more automatic times. eg: logarithmic? so when
you're at 5 minutes, update the time every 30 seconds. when you're at one minute
update every 15? and when you're at 15 update every 5, and when you're at 5, 
update every 1

1 *5 -> 5 *6 -> 30 *5 -> 2m30s *6 -> 15m


| time calculation | time | interval |
+------------------+------+----------+
|1*5=5             | < 5s | 1 second |
|_*6=30            | <30s | 5 secs   |
|_*5=150(2m30)     | <2m30| 
                   | >15m |


19) ps: cool

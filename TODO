TODO:
- these are sorted in terms of increasing likelihood to get done first
- eg: the last item on the list is more likely to get finished, and removed


1) fix all the FIXME's/TODO's


2) add support for gconf (eg: to replace yaml or add an additional parser, or
perhaps in particular for the users config and not the daemon's)


3) add test cases! including check for license text, source formatting, etc...


4) dependency checking:
package: libxss-dev
package: yaml, pynotify


5) option to have eva running, and to disable the shutdown backend or viceversa
note: to disable backend, just put an exclude on user `root' (or whatever user
it runs as... see the faq for a better explanation) However, this should be a
hack solution since if we change the user the daemon runs as, then this setting
gets scrapped. we want something more portable.


6) evanescent-daemon should maybe run as user `daemon' or eva or some other user account to give it less priviledges.


7) add _() for gettext, get the gettext infrastructure scripts going, cleanup messages


8) deb package


9) setup.py needs some love


10) setup.py script has hardcoded directories.


11) logout.py needs a bit more love (just got some dbus up in there)


12) countdown could update at more automatic times. eg: logarithmic? so when
you're at 5 minutes, update the time every 30 seconds. when you're at one minute
update every 15? and when you're at 15 update every 5, and when you're at 5, 
update every 1

1 *5 -> 5 *6 -> 30 *5 -> 2m30s *6 -> 15m


| time calculation | time | interval |
+------------------+------+----------+
|1*5=5             | < 5s | 1 second |
|_*6=30            | <30s | 5 secs   |
|_*5=150(2m30)     | <2m30| 
                   | >15m |


13) watch configuration file for changed exclusions through a FILE io watcher.
if any changes are made, then kill the sleeping loop and make it run right away.
look at comments in: def get_exclusions_changed_time()


14) fix the icon size business.


15) support for additional actions instead of logout?
this should be stored in the .eva.conf.yaml file, and should be parsed by the
evanescent-preferences program, similar in visual design to vino-preferences.
do: apt-get source vino and have a look inside the capplet/ folder.


16) add some love to the config.py and associated managing of configurations.


17) play a sound on idle (libcanberra?)

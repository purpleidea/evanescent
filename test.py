"""
Test infrastructure main entry point.

Running this file kicks of the entire set of test cases included in the TESTS
folder. Tests in that folder may also be run individually from within that
folder or from within this working directory. Individual tests need only to
import the unittest module, and to include a small amount of python boilerplate
which enables these test cases to play nicely with the main suite.

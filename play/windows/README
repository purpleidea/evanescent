It seems that it is almost impossible to duplicate the features of linux based evanescent in windows.
There needs to be a system wide service or daemon running that detects when the machine is idle.
This would run as a system/root type user.
It would use the GetLastInputInfo Function @ http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms646302(VS.85).aspx to get idle time information.
However, it is impossible for this process to do GetLastInputInfo for any process other than itself.
So you could do a RunAs type thing (wrapper in an existing RunAs api) and run that for each user you want idle time information about.
But to do the RunAs you need the users password, even though you are the Administrator user.
You could run a separate program that starts up with each user login as themselves. (such as through the all users/startup folder) and then
then program could report idle time back to some common file on the filesystem, and then then main evanescent daemon could select/poll this
file and determine idle info that way. This is hacky, but potentially could be possible.

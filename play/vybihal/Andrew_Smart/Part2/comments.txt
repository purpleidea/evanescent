The existing code base is well written in the sense that is is very clear what must be done, what has been done, 
and possible things that might need to be done. With the abundace of comments and TODO's found through the code, 
it is always clear what must be done. As this is the first assignment for anyone in our group where we got to build 
on a significant code base, it was nice that that is was well structured and simple to follow. This can be said for
 the main files such as exclusions and dt. However, the same cannot be said for the less viewed files where the commenting 
ranges from very precise to rather informal to a point where the comments do little to provide information on what a problem may be. 
This minor complaint aside, the code was well written in terms of reusability (especially when it came to implementing date) and formatting.
 As for Evanescence as a whole, it was very helpful to have the dependencies included in the tarball. Code aside, it was a nice change to 
work on something real and potentialy improve it to the point that it could be used (if only it weren't the end of semester and we had more time).



This is what the time should look like on the yaml file
-It has quotes
-Inclusive or exclusive brackets
-It can either be an interval or just a single time with a star


time: '[10:45:13 , 13:56:34]'

will include anything from 13:56:34 to 10:45:13 included

time: '[10:*]'

will include anything from 10:00:00 to 10:59:59 included

time: ']10:10:*['

will include anything from 10:10:00 to 10:10:59 excluded


This is what the date sould look like on the yaml file
- it doesn't have quotes 
- It is always inclusive to the last date

date: '1990, 2009'

will include anthing from febuary first 1990 to december 31st 2009 included


date: '1990-10-10, 2009-10-19'

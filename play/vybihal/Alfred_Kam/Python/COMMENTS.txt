General Discussion/comments on changes made for Task 1

1) Changes to dt.py

	1. Finished the time implementation which allows for entering only one value 

		(ie) 
			a. 7
			b. 2:23
			c. 5:23:56

	assumes a two hour range/window so basically takes that changes above to 

			a. 7,9
			b. 2:23, 4:23
			c. 5:23:56, 7:23:56

	this was done as a two hour window seemed appropriate. Reused logic implemented by earlier part of the code

	2. Implemented date

	Dates can only be inputed using this syntax [#/#/####,#/#/####]
	
	makes use of logic from first part of code (since where actually still comparing strings of integers using
	tokenizer/split)

	3. My understanding of what happens in the code (THe Algorithm if you will)

		Basically, given the range to be checked as 1 string using specific syntax
		

		make sure correct syntax used for string
		
		check boundaries

		remove brackets/boundaries

		split string in TWO (left half = lhs), (right half = rhs)

		further split the halfs between the three "subcategories" (hours, minutes, seconds OR day, month, year)

		for TIME
			use defaults for anything missing ie) only hours OR only hours:minutes OR all

		for DAY
			TECHNICALLY does not need defaults as it assumes that user MUST input 2 FULL DATES

				why? Because otherwise it DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

		Then, it checks the lower bound (lhs)

		Then, it checks the upper bound (rhs)

		If after all that it doesn't return false, then RETURN TRUE


2) Change to exclusions.py

	1. finish the elif j == Date block

	2. create an elif j == IPV4 block
		gets the ip address (which searching on the internet tells me is IPV4 (first google search result)
		checks it
		either return true or false and BREAK

******************************
Due to time constraints did not have enough time to implement the Windows installer + could not find any documentation
on how to accomplish task from little info provided in assignment.

I was however able to find out how to use py2exe to create a .exe version of a python code/program

I am however, personally interested on how that would actually be done. If it's not too much to ask to send at my
e-mail sample code/ STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO DO THIS FOR A SIMPLE PROGRAM 

Sort of a How to make an installer for windows for DUMMIES (I wasted a lot of time trying to make this work,
was extremely frustrated untill I finally gave up and caved into handing in the much simpler task (my back-up))

If done much appreciated

installing evanescent:

installing on linux is a flash.
1) put the code wherever you'd like it to run from.
2) copy a template .conf file to /etc/ and edit it appropriately.
3) add the upstart file provided.

installing on windows is a bit involved.
1) you need to put the code in an appropriate folder.
2) you need an evanescent.job file (scripts to install this are in progress)
3) you need a registry entry. (scripts to install this are in progress)

ask me for windows deployment help!
i'm working on making the install automatic

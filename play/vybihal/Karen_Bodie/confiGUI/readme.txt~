(1) WHAT IS confiGUI?
(2) MAKING YAML FILES FOR EVANESCENT PROJECT
(3) THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR

======================================================================

(1) WHAT IS confiGUI?
	
This python/gtk/glade application was designed to create, display, and
edit files for use in the McGill cs evanescent project. It allows the
user to set up configuration settings, and to specify exceptions that 
stop evanescent from powersaving.

Run confiGUI from the command line: "python confGUI.py"

=======================================================================

(2) MAKING YAML FILES FOR EVANESCENT PROJECT

-Creating a new file.
	An empty workspace is created upon opening the application. A new 
	file is created as soon as the user specifies a filename with
	full filepath in the first entry box and presses "save". 
	
-Opening a file.
	Type the file path in the text box and click "Open". If the
	file cannot be found, nothing will appear in the tree view,
	and the terminal will report "Cannot open file.". You'll
	know if it opens, since it will list all the exceptions in 
	the file! Note that this file must be in yaml format, and that
	currently, only the following exception categories will be 
	recognised in this app: host, user, date, time, fqdn, and note.
	Any other categories will be lost upon saving, so be careful. 

-Editing a file
	To add an exception, click "add" then "exception" on the menu
	bar. It is the only item on the menu bar. This will prompt a
	window to pop up called "Add Exception". Fill in the boxes with
	the new exception properies, and click OK. The time category
	should be in the following syntax: [9:00:00, 19:00:00].The note 
	category is just to keep track of what the exception is about.

	To change a configuration setting, simply select the setting 
	to change from the combo box, type the new value in the text box
	adjacent to it, and click "Save Setting". The new value will
	appear in the config settings tree view.

-Saving a file
	Type the path of the file to save as in the box, and click "Save".
	The output format is not as pretty as the example files, but it
	is in yaml and works, and is reopenable by confiGUI.

-Exiting
	Just click the "x" in the top right-hand corner.

========================================================================

(3) THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR

-Overwriting files is very easy to do. That is, don't accidentally click 
"Save" instead of "Open" when you have a blank space, since the file
will be immediately cleared. Yikes, I know.

-Exceptions cannot be individually deleted in this version of confiGUI.
The only option is to delete all exceptions and start fresh! The config
settings, however, are NOT deleted when "Clear All Exceptions" is clicked.

-There are probably other things that could go wrong. My advice to you
is to back up any files you try to edit with the program, until a more
robust version is on the market!


Thanks for trying confiGUI, and enjoy!

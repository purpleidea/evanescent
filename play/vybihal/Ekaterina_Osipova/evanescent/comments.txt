The code base for the exculusions.py is well-organized such that the user can easily follow the case-senarios (such as date, or time) in which
the variable row either returns true or false. There should be a more thorough description as to what specifically the variables i and j 
represent relative to the yaml file.

The code base for the dt.py is well-constructed and organized. There is a sufficient amount of code that helps the user understand what is 
happening. Also, the code for the time-based range allowed us to write the date-based range such that the consistency of the code was perserved.

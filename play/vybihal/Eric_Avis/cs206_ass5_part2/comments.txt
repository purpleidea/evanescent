#COMMENTS

Here are a few comments I have compiled after working on this project.  I have never actually worked on any real project before, and have very little experience programming in general, but I have nonetheless tried to give some constructive criticism.

-Open and closing brackets for date/time, i.e. [9,12] vs ]9,12[

I don't really understand the use of having these, especially for time.  The inclusion/exclusions only seem to apply to the seconds (not minutes or hours), since if one decides not the specify the seconds and/or minutes, they are automatically given the default values.  So for example, if I were to write [9,12] as opposed to ]9,12[, it seems like the code would interpret this as [9:00:00,12:00:00] as opposed to ]9:00:00,12:00:00[, which are, for practicaly purposes, the same.  Also, there is the danger that a user may interpret ]9,12[ as something other than ]9:00:00,12:00:00[.  Thus, it seems like these brackets don't add anything useful to the program and may lead to confusion, so I would suggest removing or reworking them.  The same goes for the date brackets.

-The * or ?? symbols in date/time

I did not implement the * since it's essentially the same as letting the minutes and/or seconds blank.  I also made the ?? mandatory for dates (instead of allowing blank months and dates) to make the code more readable and to avoid any confusion when only entering one date.

-Other comments

The very large amount of files and code seemed a bit overwhelming at first, for what seemed to be a relatively simple task.  However, I now think that the whole project is very well structured this way, and it certainly made the debugging of the date/time functions a lot easier than I would have expected.  Hence, the code base seems very efficient, as long as it doesn't get too large and overcomplicated.

Exclusion by IP
---------------

Note that this feature does not support specifying for a given interface. 
Therefore, the default interface will be used. Furthermore, if /etc/hosts
contains an entry where the hostname is refered to 127.0.0.1, then exclusion
won't work. For Windows based machine, it should return the correct IP address.

Note that a true cross platform solution is not available in Python. 
Some librairies might exist for that purpose, but none have been found.


Exclusion by Date
-----------------
It seems that an error was made in is_time. According to :

http://python.active-venture.com/lib/datetime-datetime.html

The only comparision operation supported is datetime1 < datetime2, but >= was used.
Time feature was therefore not working because of this (returning false) and causing
the is_time to return false. 
		
Syntax:
	- open or close bracket, for inclusion or exclusion (respectively) of boundary value
	- date value>>> year[,month[,day]] (days are optional)
	- semi-colon
	- time value as above
	- open or close bracket, for exclusion or inclusion (respectively) of boundary value

	* example:	[2008,12,20; 2009,01,05[
	* example:	]2010,04,17 ;2010,06,03]
	* example:	2009,05,01;2010,09,01
	
	
Improvements
------------
- Something prettier should be found instead of the the big if/elif statement in exclusion.py.
- make tar fails at producing the tar archive because of bzr. It should only produce the tarball
and nothing else. Commiting to Bazaar shouldn't be part of that target.
- providing a "make install" target


pynotfiy
--------
This project was really late in the semester. Implementing pynotify would have been something great
to do, but because of the lack of time, we settle down on something that we could do within that 
time frame. Here is a sample pynotify program that pops out a message with a button.

#!/usr/bin/python
import pynotify
def get_user_response(notification=None, action=None, data=None):
     print "Fine, won't shutdown"

pynotify.init( "Evanescent" )
n = pynotify.Notification("Title", "The system will be shutdown", "dialog-warning")
n.set_urgency(pynotify.URGENCY_NORMAL)
n.set_timeout(pynotify.EXPIRES_NEVER)
n.add_action("clicked","Button text", get_user_response, None)
n.show()

With a bit more work, it could have been added easily.

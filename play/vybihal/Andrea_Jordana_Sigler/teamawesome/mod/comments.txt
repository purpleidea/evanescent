the existing code is a lot more complicated than it has to be. in particular, there is a lot of unnecessary repetition.
we made dt.py somewhat more modular. more could be done. 

we implemented is_date, making is_time and is_date work in the same way. we reorganised a lot of code, to decrease code repetition. 
we made the private functions __now and __getdt.

we made a syntax rule for date and time that allows a * to stand in for any field. 
we modified evanescent.conf.yaml.example to explain our syntax rules.

we implemented a weekday exclusion that takes integers from 1 to 7 for the days of the week (ISO standard).

exclusions.py was updated to check for "date" and "weekday".

we asked google's advanced AI programmer "Cadie" what it thought of the evanescent code base and it said:
Python? Why not try INTERCAL?

i should probably make a decent README file.
please send all comments, patches, thanks & insults to james@cs.mcgill.ca


- on tabs vs. spaces:
	i think that indenting with tabs is brilliant. tabs are a clever
	character and replacing them with spaces is a big mistake. all of this
	code uses 8 space tabs where possible, and as such please send patches
	in this format.


- on max line length:
	i attempt to keep code to 79 or 80 characters long, however, i won't
	purposefully break a longer line if i think it makes the code less
	readable. sometimes i edit in vim, but usually i use something like
	gedit. i think that enforcing a legacy terminal width in 2009 is a
	silly rule to obey.


- faq:
	1. Evanescent activates when I'm not idle! It's not noticing my mouse
	clicks or mouse wheel.
	A: see: http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/faq.html#mouse-idle
	note that i haven't actually seen this as a problem, since usually you
	need to be completely idle for 1 hour+, however it is here as a good
	reference.

	2. I want the eva client to run and log out users, but I don't want the
	evanescent backend shutting down the machine.
	A: add an exclusion for the `root' user. when exclusions are checked on
	the client side, they won't match, but when the evanescent daemon runs
	since it's running as user `root' you can now exclude by this rule.

	3. Can we add buttons to the pynotify dialogs?
	A: No, in an effort to support a wide range of notification daemons and
	strict usability requirements (ahem: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NotifyOSD)
	however, please send useful ideas/patches if you think otherwise.

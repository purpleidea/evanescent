i should probably make a decent README file.
please send all comments, patches, thanks & insults to james@cs.mcgill.ca


- on tabs vs. spaces:
	i think that indenting with tabs is brilliant. tabs are a clever
	character and replacing them with spaces is a big mistake. all of this
	code uses 8 space tabs where possible, and as such please send patches
	in this format.


- on max line length:
	i attempt to keep code to 79 or 80 characters long, however, i won't
	purposefully break a longer line if i think it makes the code less
	readable. sometimes i edit in vim, but usually i use something like
	gedit. i think that enforcing a legacy terminal width in 2009 is a
	silly rule to obey.


- faq:
	1. Evanescent activates when I'm not idle! It's not noticing my mouse
	clicks or mouse wheel.

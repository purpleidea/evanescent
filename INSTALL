installing evanescent:

- on linux:
$ make install
(this will run the distutils install target with sudo) 
note: this *could* overwrite any exisiting /etc/evanescent.yaml.conf file that
you have, so backup your old one beforehand please.


- on windows:
(this can be more involved, and is currently untested with version 0.2- this
worked with version 0.1 if you want to try the old evanescent)
1) you need to put the code in an appropriate folder.
2) you need an evanescent.job file (scripts to install this are in progress)
3) you need a registry entry. (scripts to install this are in progress)

ask me for windows deployment help!
i'm working on making the install automatic with distutils
